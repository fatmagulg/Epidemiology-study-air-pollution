# Epidemiology-study-air-pollution

Exposure to air pollution is believed impact health and reduce life expectancy. Using the dataset included in the repository we will estimate
the effect of air pollution exposure on health using a statistical model. The dataset contains information on all Intermediate Zones (IZ)
of Scotland and numerous covariates.

covariates:
**IZ**:A unique code for each IZ
**name**: the name of the IZ
**YhospResp**: number of respiratory hospitalisations in the IZ in 2015-2016
**EhospResp**: expected number of respiratory hospitaliations for the IZ based on population size and demographic structure
**employment, income, crime, housing, education, access**: measures of socio-economic deprivation for each IZ
**no2, pm10**: measures of air pollutants in micrograms/metre3; nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter with diameter â‰¤ 10 micrograms

Question of interest: **What is the effect of air pollution on the risk of respiratory hospitalisation in Scotland?**
